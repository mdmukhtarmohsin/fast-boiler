`fast-boiler` is a command-line tool that scaffolds a complete FastAPI application using the robust **Repository â†’ Service â†’ Controller** layering pattern. Stop writing boilerplate and start building features.

### Why Use Fast Boiler?

-   **Scalable by Default**: The generated structure cleanly separates database logic (Repositories), business logic (Services), and API endpoints (Controllers), making your project easy to maintain and grow.
-   **Best Practices Included**: Uses the latest, non-deprecated syntax for FastAPI, Pydantic V2, and SQLAlchemy 2.0.
-   **Blazing Fast Workflow**: Initialize a full project with one command and generate all the files for new resources (models, schemas, repos, services, controllers) with another.
-   **Asynchronous Ready**: Although the default is synchronous for simplicity, the structure is perfectly suited for easy conversion to async.

##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have **Python 3.8+** and **`pipx`** installed on your system.

`pipx` is a tool to install and run Python applications in isolated environments. It's the recommended way to install command-line tools like this one. If you don't have it, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

*(You may need to restart your terminal after running `pipx ensurepath`.)*

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Installing `fast-boiler` is a one-line command:

```bash
pipx install fast-boiler
```

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
fast-boiler --help```

## ðŸš€ Quickstart: Create Your First Project

Let's build a new API in under a minute.

### 1. Initialize a New Project

This command creates a new directory with a complete FastAPI project structure, including a default `user` resource.

```bash
fast-boiler init myapi
```

This will create the following structure:
```
myapi/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ app/
    â”œâ”€â”€ database.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_controller.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_model.py
    # ... and so on
```

### 2. Run the API Server

Navigate into your new project, install its dependencies, and run the server.

```bash
# Navigate into the project
cd myapi

# (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dev server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload```

Your API is now live! Open your browser to **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`** to see the interactive Swagger UI for the `/users` endpoint.

### 3. Generate a New Resource

Now for the fun part. Let's add endpoints for managing `products`.

Open a **new terminal**, navigate to your project's root directory (`myapi`), and run the `generate` command.

```bash
cd /path/to/myapi
fast-boiler generate product
```

This command automatically creates:
- `app/models/product_model.py`
- `app/schemas/product_schema.py`
- `app/repositories/product_repo.py`
- `app/services/product_service.py`
- `app/controllers/product_controller.py`

### 4. Activate the New Resource

The final step is to tell your main application about the new controller. Open `myapi/app/main.py` and include the new router:

```python
# In myapi/app/main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.database import Base, engine
# ðŸ‘‡ 1. IMPORT THE NEW CONTROLLER
from app.controllers import user_controller, product_controller

Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI(...)

app.include_router(user_controller.router)
# ðŸ‘‡ 2. INCLUDE THE NEW ROUTER
app.include_router(product_controller.router)

# ... rest of the file
```
When you save the file, the `uvicorn` server will automatically reload. Refresh your browser, and you'll see the new `/products` endpoints in the API documentation.

### Explanation of the `README.md` Sections

1.  **Title and Badges**:
    *   `Fast Boiler ðŸš€`: A clear, memorable name with an emoji to grab attention.
    *   **Badges (`[![...]]`)**: These provide quick, at-a-glance information.
        *   `PyPI version`: Links directly to your package on PyPI, showing the latest version number. (You'll need to update the badge URL if you change the package name).
        *   `License`: Shows the open-source license, which is important for users to know if they can use your tool.

2.  **Introduction**:
    *   A short, bold tagline that explains the tool's main purpose immediately.
    *   A brief paragraph expanding on what the tool is and the architecture it promotes.

3.  **"Why Use Fast Boiler?"**:
    *   This is your sales pitch. It highlights the key benefits and tells users why they should choose your tool over manual setup. It focuses on value (scalability, best practices, speed).

4.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   This is a critical section for preventing user frustration. It clearly states what a user needs *before* they can install your tool.
    *   It explicitly mentions `pipx` and provides the commands to install it, explaining *why* it's the recommended method.

5.  **Installation**:
    *   A simple, copy-and-paste command block. This should be as frictionless as possible.
    *   Includes a verification step (`--help`) so the user can confirm the installation was successful.

6.  **Quickstart**:
    *   This is the most important section. It's a hands-on tutorial that walks the user through the entire workflow, from an empty directory to a running server with a custom resource.
    *   **Numbered Steps**: Makes the process easy to follow.
    *   **Code Blocks**: Uses clear, copy-and-pasteable commands.
    *   **Visuals/Outputs**: It shows the expected directory structure to give the user confidence that they're on the right track.
    *   **Clear Instructions**: It explains *what* each command does (e.g., "This command creates a new directory...").

7.  **Contributing & License**:
    *   Standard sections for open-source projects. They tell others how they can get involved and what the usage rights are.
